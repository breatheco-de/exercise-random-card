</p>

In this project you will learn how to change your website styles during the runtime using [VanillaJS](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/20435653/what-is-vanillajs) (plain normal js).

# üìù Instructions

Create an algorithm that randomly builds a card on every refresh:

1. Every time the website refreshes a new random card needs to show.

2. The card must have one of the possible suits: Hearts, Spades, Clubs and Diamonds.

3. The card value must be one of the following: 1 to 10, King, Queen, Jack or Ace, (no joker).

In the end, the project needs to look similar to [this demo](https://github.com/breatheco-de/exercise-random-card/blob/master/preview.gif?raw=true).

## üå±  How to start this project

 Do not clone this repository.

The first step to start coding is cloning the [vanilla.js boilerplate](https://github.com/4GeeksAcademy/vanillajs-hello.git) on your local computer or gitpod.

a) If using Gitpod (recommended) you can clone the boilerplate by [clicking here](https://github.com/4GeeksAcademy/vanillajs-hello.git).

b) If working locally type the following command from your command line:

```sh

$ git clone https://github.com/4GeeksAcademy/vanillajs-hello.git

```

## üí° Important: 

Remember to create a new repository, update the remote (`git remote set-url origin <your new url>`), and upload the code to your new repository using `add`, `commit` and `push`.

## üí° Hints

- Remember that the first event of a website lifecycle is [onLoad (your code starts running there)](https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/event_onload.asp). You should generate a random number between 1 and 4 to pick a suit and another random number between 0 and 12 to pick a card number.

- Create a general **.card** class that applies the general styles to each card, and one additional CSS class for each suit: .spade, .club, .heart & .diamond.

- Apply the .card class to the entire div but only apply one of the suit classes at a time, depending on what suit you want to apply. For example, a 3 of Hearts will have this HTML declaration:

```html
    <div class='card heart'></div>
```

- You can grab the icons from here (copy and paste into your code): ‚ô¶ ‚ô• ‚ô† ‚ô£

## üòé Feeling Confident?

The following requirements are not needed to sucessfully finish this project, but you can try and challenge yourself!

`+1` Add a button that generates a new card when clicked. 

`+1` Add a timer that generates a new card every 10 seconds.   

`+1` Allow the user to specify the card width and height using text inputs.
